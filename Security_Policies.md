**1.**

**Purpose**

This policy is intended to minimize security risks associated with employees using company-owned devices over unsecured or shared home Wi-Fi networks. It requires the use of a dedicated, private Wi-Fi connection when working remotely to prevent lateral attacks, unauthorized access, and data exposure.

**2.**

**Scope**

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party users who access company resources using company-issued devices from a remote location.

**3.**

**Policy**

- Employees must not connect company-issued laptops or devices to personal, shared, or guest home networks.
- A dedicated SSID (Wi-Fi network name) must be used for work purposes. This may be:
  - A separate router exclusively for work, or
  - A VLAN or guest network configured on an existing router, with strong encryption (WPA2/WPA3).
- Employees must ensure the following:
  - The Wi-Fi network is secured with a strong password.
  - Router firmware is regularly updated.
  - The default admin credentials of the router have been changed.
  - Unknown or untrusted devices are not connected to the same work Wi-Fi.

**4.**

**Enforcement**

Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, including loss of remote access privileges or further IT restrictions. The IT Security team reserves the right to audit and verify network configuration as part of routine checks.

**5.**

**Exceptions**

Requests for exception due to technical or location-based constraints must be submitted in writing to the IT Security Manager for review and documented approval.

**6.**

**Review and Maintenance**

This policy shall be reviewed every 6 months or upon significant changes to the company‚Äôs remote access infrastructure.
